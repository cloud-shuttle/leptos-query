## ‚úÖ Where leptos-query-rs Excels

### 1. Type Safety & Compile-Time Guarantees
```rust
// Rust: Compile-time type checking
let user: Result<User, QueryError> = use_query(&["user", id], fetch_user).await;
```
vs
```typescript
// TypeScript: Runtime type checking
const { data: user, error } = useQuery(['user', id], fetchUser);
```

**Advantage**: Rust provides compile-time guarantees that prevent entire classes of runtime errors.

### 2. Memory Safety & Performance
- **No garbage collection overhead** - Predictable performance
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - High-level code compiles to efficient machine code
- **Compile-time optimizations** - Rust compiler optimizes aggressively
- **No runtime type errors** - All type checking happens at compile time

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **Native SSR support** without hydration issues
- **Consistent behavior** between server and client
- **Built-in hydration handling** with proper state synchronization
- **No client-server mismatch** problems

### 4. Local-First Architecture (v0.5.1+)
- **CRDT-based conflict resolution** for real-time collaboration
- **Offline-first** with automatic sync when connection returns

- **Conflict-free replicated data types** for complex scenarios

### 5. WebAssembly Performance
- **Near-native performance** in browsers
- **Small bundle sizes** due to efficient compilation
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (same code runs everywhere)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Where TanStack Query Still Leads

```rust
// Compiler prevents entire classes of errors
let user: User = query.data.unwrap(); // Safe unwrap with proper error handling
```

### 4. SSR Excellence
Native server-side rendering without hydration complexity:
```rust
// Same code works on server and client
let user_query = use_query(&["user", &id], fetch_user, QueryOptions::default());
```

### 5. Offline-First
Built-in offline support with automatic synchronization:
```rust
// Operations are queued when offline and synced when online
sync_manager.queue_operation(operation).await?;
```
