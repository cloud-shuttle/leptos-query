### **Performance Targets**
- **Query Operations**: < 1ms for simple queries
- **Cache Operations**: < 100μs for cache hits
- **Advanced Features**: < 1ms for optimistic updates
- **Memory Usage**: < 20MB for typical usage

### **Feature Completeness**
- **v0.5.0**: 100% of planned features implemented
- **Advanced Features**: 100% of planned features implemented
- **Integration**: All features work together seamlessly
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade quality

## 🎯 **Implementation Approach**

### **Development Methodology**
- **TDD-First**: All features start with tests
- **Incremental Development**: Small, testable increments
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every change
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple testing approaches
